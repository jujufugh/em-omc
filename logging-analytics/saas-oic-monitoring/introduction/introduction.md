# Introduction

## About this Workshop 

In this workshop, you will learn how to streamline cross-team troubleshooting for Oracle Fusion Applications using a Purchase Order (PO) business flow as the core example. Learn how Oracle Log Analytics enables DevOps, integration, and application teams to collaboratively investigate performance and reliability issues across Fusion Applications, Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC), and Oracle Database. You'll simulate a real-world PO scenario and apply advanced log-based correlation techniques to monitor, trace, and troubleshoot the end-to-end flow. Gain practical observability skills to improve performance, resilience, and operational efficiency in Oracle-driven business processes.

OCI Log Analytics is a cloud solution that aggregates, indexes, and analyzes a variety of log data from on-premises and multi-cloud environments. It enables you to search, explore, and correlate this data, derive operational insights and make informed decisions.

Estimated Workshop Time: 01 hours 30 minutes


### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

* **Understand the End-to-End Architecture of a typical business process**: Grasp the functional and technical flow of a Purchase Order (PO) business process involving Oracle ERP Cloud, OIC, and B2B trading partners.

* **Identify Key Integration Points and Observability Hooks**: Recognize where logs are generated across Fusion Applications, Oracle Integration Cloud, and Oracle Database.

* **Monitor and Analyze Component-Level Behavior**: Use observability tools to assess performance, audit trails, and error logs in individual components (ERP, OIC, DB).

* **Correlate Logs Across Systems for E2E Visibility**: Stitch together logs and telemetry to trace transactions end-to-end across ERP Cloud, integration flows, and database services.

* **Diagnose and Troubleshoot Business Flow Failures**: Investigate and resolve real-world issues (e.g., faulty EDI entries) using log-based insights and cross-component traceability.

* **Enhance Operational Efficiency Through Observability**: Apply observability best practices to improve system resilience, reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR), and support collaborative DevSecOps workflows.

* **Learn OCI Log Analytics fundamentals** in the context of Oracle Fusion Applications and Infrastructure

* **Master advanced ML-based analytics** to understand large volumes of logs in a structured way for root cause analysis

* **Apply log correlation techniques** to debug complex business processes and integration flows

* **Utilize monitoring dashboards** for real-time operational insights
